Hi, I am Jayant Taneja, presently a Machine Learning Engineer at [Samsung Research and Development Institute India-Delhi](https://research.samsung.com/sri-d), where I work on intelligent screen experiences via Generative AI and Recommender Systems.

Previously, I worked as an Analytics Intern at [Swiggy](https://www.swiggy.com/) where I worked on improving the in-house payments platform by analyzing terabytes of payments data.

My research interests include Information Retrieval, Natural Language Processing and Recommender Systems.
